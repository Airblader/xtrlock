.TH XTRLOCK 1
.SH NAME
xtrlock \- Lock X display until password supplied, leaving windows visible
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xtrlock [-b] [-f]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xtrlock
locks the X server till the user enters their password at the keyboard.

While
.B xtrlock
is running, the mouse and keyboard are grabbed and the mouse cursor
becomes a padlock.  Output displayed by X programs, and windows put up
by new X clients, continue to be visible, and any new output is
displayed normally.

The mouse and keyboard are returned when the user types their
password, followed by Enter or Newline.  If an incorrect password is
entered the bell is sounded.  Pressing Backspace or Delete erases one
character of a password partially typed; pressing Escape or Clear
clears anything that has been entered.

If too many attempts are made in too short a time further keystrokes
generate bells and are otherwise ignored until a timeout has expired.

The X server screen saver continues to operate normally; if it comes
into operation the display may be restored by the usual means of
touching a key (Shift, for example) or the mouse.
